noise = 2 for eps=0.5 didn't work even with order = 96. Epsilon is just too small.

eps=0.5: noise = 6 gives the best accuracy; the second best is noise=8.
eps=0.8: noise = 4 gives the best accuracy
eps=1.4: noise = 4 gives the best accuracy
I use moment order 32 as usual for eps=0.8,1.4; but 96 for eps-0.5, for otherwise it does not work
