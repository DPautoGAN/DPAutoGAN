The evaluation notebook can be run as is with synthetic data included in the folder.
As a result, the simplest way to get the histrogram and diversty scores is by download this entire folder as is, and run the notebook from top to bottom.

Note that we include more synthetic data from different methods than in the paper. If you are interested, you may check the result of other synthetic data as well, or even of your own.
