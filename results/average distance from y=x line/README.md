Algorithm are listed first, then the average of categorical, continuous, then the label salary feature. For DP-SYN, we also split out 4 features that output only one class. Weights indicate number of features in that type, e.g. how many categorical features are being averaged. Average_all is when we take all average. However, since this average both R^2 and F_1 scores, it can be in appropriate, so only average of F_1 score is also calculated.  -1 indicates that the category does not exist, so the average is invalid.
