We tested the diversity divergence score (the lower, the better, with score = 0 if and only if the synthetic data exactly matches the original data in that feature_.

Four algorithms are tested for different epsilon values. We also test DP-SYN on two preprocessing method: by the original author and by ours we use for Dp-auto-GAN. We report the original author one, which is better.
